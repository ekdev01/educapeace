Having left my country Cameroon about ten years ago, I built myself by learning for my future, for the youngest, for the underprivileged
president.text.3: Thus, was born the association Educapeace
president.text.4: Educapeace is in partnership with public schools in Cameroon (4 at the moment) where every year we offer scholarships and school supplies to children to encourage them to go to school.
president.text.5: Each year we help more than 600 children, and to date we have already built two wells of drinking water.
president.text.6: Together we want to give children even more smile, allow them to go to school because we understood the value / power of the school, then allow them access to equipment such as drinking water, latrines, library ... To improve their living conditions, reduce the rate of school absenteeism, waterborne diseases and even mortality.
president.text.7: We thank you for your support in this fight that is close to our hearts.
